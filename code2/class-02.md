parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
* **Using CSS**:
1. External: by write the CSS in a file and link it eith the HTML oage using **<link>** tag.
2. Internal: by write it inside the HTML page using **<style>** tag 
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
