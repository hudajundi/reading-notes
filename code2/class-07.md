## Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

## HTML
### Tables
* Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
<form> element.

* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.
