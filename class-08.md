## CSS
### LayOut
* Fixed width layout: Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels. 
* Liquid layouts : Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.
* Layout grids : Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
* **Framworks** : CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page
