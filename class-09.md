## JavaScript
### Events

* Events are the browser's way of indicating when
something has happened (such as when a page has
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting
for that event to happen upon.
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.
* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events.
