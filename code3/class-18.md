# Regex Tutorial
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters). Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping. One of the most interesting features is that once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages ​​(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, and many others) with the slightest distinctions about the support of the most advanced features and syntax versions supported by the engines).the application fields of regex can be multiple:data validation (for example check if a time string i well-formed).data scraping (especially web scraping, find all pages that contain a certain set of words eventually in a specific order).data wrangling (transform data from “raw” to another format).string parsing (for example catch all URL GET parameters, capture text inside a set of parenthesis).string replacement (for example, even during a code session using a common IDE to translate a Java or C# class in the respective JSON object — replace “;” with “,” make it lowercase, avoid type declaration, etc).syntax highlightning, file renaming, packet sniffing and many other applications involving strings (where data need not be textual).
# CSS Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements. An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.Grid gives us control over how wide or narrow each of the ‘grid cells’ get. This allows us to maintain a sensible aspect ratio to their height.
